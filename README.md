# Crimes_Against_Women_India

The identification of crime hotspots is crucial for developing effective law enforcement strategies and ensuring public safety. This project focuses on detecting clusters of states with similar patterns of crimes against women in India, using data from 2001 to 2021. The dataset includes specific crime categories such as Rape, Kidnapping/Abduction, Dowry Deaths, Assault on Women, Domestic Violence, and Women Trafficking.

The central questions guiding this investigation include: Which states exhibit similar patterns of these crimes? Can states be categorized into distinct clusters based on the type and frequency of crimes against women? To explore these questions, I will employ K-Means clustering to group states according to their crime statistics.
